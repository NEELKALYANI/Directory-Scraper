# Directory-Scraper
This Python script uses Selenium to scrape certified coach listings from Gallupâ€™s directory. It selects each country from a dropdown, extracts coach names, emails, and profile image URLs, and saves the data to an Excel file (scraped_data.xlsx). The script runs in headless mode and uses explicit waits for dynamic content loading.
